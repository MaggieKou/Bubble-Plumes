    abstract = {Buoyant plumes form when glacial ice melts directly into the ocean or when subglacial meltwater is discharged to the ocean at depth. They play a key role in regulating heat transport from the ocean to the ice front, and in exporting glacial meltwater to the open ocean. This review summarises current understanding of the dynamics of these plumes, focussing on theoretical developments and their predictions for submarine melt rates. These predictions are sensitive to ocean temperature, the magnitude and spatial distribution of subglacial discharge, the ambient stratiﬁcation and, in the case of sub-ice-shelf plumes, the geometry of the ice shelf. However, current understanding relies heavily on parameterisations of melting and entrainment for which there is little in the way of validation. New observational and experimental constraints are needed to elucidate the structure of the plumes and lend greater conﬁdence to the models.},

    abstract = {In an experimental and theoretical study we model the convection generated in the polar oceans when a fresh-water ice wall melts in salt water of uniform far-field temperature T∞, and salinity S∞. Our laboratory results show that there are three different flow regimes which depend on T∞ and S∞. First, when T∞ and S∞ lie between the maximum density curve and the freezing curve, the flow is only upward. Secondly, for the oceanic case 30 [les ] S∞ [les ] 35‰ and T∞ {\textless} 20°C, the flow consists of a laminar bidirectional flow at the bottom of the ice and a turbulent upward flow along the remainder of the ice wall. The laminar flow consists of an upward flowing layer approximately 2 mm thick inside of a downward flowing outer layer approximately 10 mm thick. Thirdly, for the same range of S∞ but for T∞ {\textgreater} 20°C, the flow reverses: at the top of the ice there is a laminar bidirectional flow above a downward turbulent flow. To model the turbulent upward flow theoretically, we numerically solve the governing equations in similarity form with a spatially varying eddy diffusivity that depends on the density difference between the ice-water interface and the far-field. The laboratory data then allows us to evaluate the dependence of eddy diffusivity on T∞ and S∞. The results show that the magnitude of the eddy diffusivity is of the same order as the molecular viscosity and that both mass injection at the interface and opposed buoyancy forces must be included in a realistic flow model. Finally, we use an integral approach to predict the far-field conditions that yield the high-temperature flow reversal and obtain a result consistent with our observations.},

Observations were made in the southwestern part of Ronne Ice Shelf, about 500 km from open water. The mean basal ablation rate was measured over a month-long and a year-long period using phase-sensitive radar to record the thinning of the ice shelf. Ocean temperatures were observed within about 25 m of the ice shelf base over the period of the radar observations, while the tidally dominated ocean currents were estimated from tidal analysis of collocated current observations from an earlier period. Ablation rates derived using these ocean data and a number of bulk parameterizations of turbulent transfer within the boundary layer are compared with the direct measurements. The ablation rates derived using a parameterization that explicitly includes the impact of ocean currents on the turbulent transfer of heat and salt match the observations to within 40\%; with suitable tuning of the drag coefficient, the mismatch can be reduced below the level of the observational errors. Equally good agreement can be obtained with two slightly simpler, current-dependent parameterizations that use constant turbulent transfer coefficients, and the optimal values for the coefficients at this particular location on Ronne Ice Shelf are given.},

A relatively low melt rate results in the case where ice overlays warm water. This agrees with some recent observations in the interior of the marginal ice zone. A surface heat sink drives the freezing case which, due to the large difference in heat and salt molecular diffusivities, produces a strong supercooling effect. This is converted into an estimate of frazil ice production through a simple scheme. The model results provide an explanation for high frazil ice concentrations observed in the Arctic and Antarctic.},

A scaling analysis shows that the flow can be described by plume equations for an outer turbulent region coupled to a resolved near-wall laminar flow. On the laboratory scale, the inner layer is dominated by its own buoyancy and the Nusselt number scales as the one-third power of the Rayleigh number (

On larger geophysical scales the buoyancy is strongest in the outer layer and the laminar layer is driven by the shear imposed on it. The predicted heat transfer correlation then has the Nusselt number proportional to the one-half power of Rayleigh number (

The criteria for transitions between flow regimes are consistent with a hierarchy of instabilities of the near-wall laminar flow, with a buoyancy-driven instability operating on the laboratory scale and a shear-driven instability operating on geophysical scales.},

    abstract = {Properly describing heat and salt flux at the ice/ocean interface is essential for understanding and modeling the energy and mass balance of drifting sea ice. Basal growth or ablation depends on the ratio, R, of the interface heat exchange coefficient to that of salt, such that as R increases so does the rate-limiting impact of salt diffusion. Observations of relatively slow melt rates in above freezing seawater (plus migration of summer “false bottoms”) suggest by analogy with laboratory studies that double diffusion of heat and salt from the ocean is important during the melting process, with numeric values for R estimated to range from 35 to 70. If the same double-diffusive principles apply for ice growth as for melting (i.e., if the process is symmetric), supercooling (possibly relieved by frazil crystal production) would occur under rapidly growing ice, yet neither extensive supercooling nor frazil accumulation is found in Arctic pack ice with limited atmospheric contact. Physical properties and turbulent fluxes of heat and salt were measured in the relatively controlled setting of a tidally driven Svalbard fjord, under growing fast ice in late winter. The data failed to show supercooling, frazil production, or enhanced heat flux, suggesting that the double diffusive process is asymmetric. Modeling results compared with measured turbulent fluxes imply that R = 1 when ice freezes; i.e., that double-diffusive tendencies are relieved at or above the immediate interface. An algorithm for calculating ice/ocean heat and salt flux accommodating the different processes is presented, along with recommended ranges for the interface exchange coefficients.},

    abstract = {Subglacial meltwater draining along the bed of fast-ﬂowing, marine-terminating glaciers emerges at the grounding line, where the ice either goes aﬂoat to form an ice shelf or terminates in a calving face. The input of freshwater to the ocean provides a source of buoyancy and drives convective motion alongside the ice–ocean interface. This process is modeled using the theory of buoyant plumes that has previously been applied to the study of the larger-scale circulation beneath ice shelves. The plume grows through entrainment of ocean waters, and the heat brought into the plume as a result drives melting at the ice–ocean interface. The equations are nondimensionalized by using scales appropriate for the region where the subglacial drainage, rather than the subsequent addition of meltwater, supplies the majority of the buoyancy forcing. It is found that the melt rate within this region can be approximated reasonably well by a function that is linear in ocean temperature, has a cube root dependence on the ﬂux of subglacial meltwater, and has a complex dependency on the slope of the ice–ocean interface. The model is used to investigate variability in melting induced by changes in both ocean temperature and subglacial discharge for a number of realistic examples of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers. The results show how warming ocean waters and increasing subglacial drainage both generate increases in melting near the grounding line.},

    abstract = {Idealized laboratory experiments have been conducted in a two-layer stratified fluid to investigate the leading-order dynamics that control submarine melting and meltwater export near a vertical ice–ocean interface as a function of subglacial discharge. In summer, the discharge of surface runoff at the base of a glacier (subglacial discharge) generates strong buoyant plumes that rise along the glacier front entraining ambient water along the way. The entrainment enhances the heat transport toward the glacier front and hence the submarine melt rate increases with the subglacial discharge rate. In the laboratory, the effect of subglacial discharge is simulated by introducing freshwater at freezing temperature from a point source at the base of an ice block representing the glacier. The circulation pattern observed both with and without subglacial discharge resembles those observed in previous observational and numerical studies. Buoyant plumes rise vertically until they find either their neutrally buoyant level or the free surface. Hence, the meltwater can deposit within the interior of the water column and not entirely at the free surface, as confirmed by field observations. The heat budget in the tank, calculated following a new framework, gives estimates of submarine melt rate that increase with the subglacial discharge and are in agreement with the directly measured submarine melting. This laboratory study provides the first direct measurements of submarine melt rates for different subglacial discharges, and the results are consistent with the predictions of previous theoretical and numerical studies.},

The experiments reported here are aimed at quantifying this effect, which could be of some importance in the application to melting icebergs. Experiments have also been carried out with heated and cooled vertical walls at larger Rayleigh numbers
              R
              than those of previous experiments.
              The main result is that for most of our experiments there is no significant difference between these three cases when properly scaled. The layer thickness over a wide range of

                w
              is approximately 0°C, whereas in colder water the freezing point depression must be taken explicitly into account. A detailed examination of the vertically flowing inner melt water layer in both homogeneous and salinity stratified cases has been made. This layer and the melt water which is mixed outwards from it into the turbulent horizontal layers have little effect on the outer flow. At high
              R
              and large external salinity, however, mixing can reduce the effective salinity at the inner edge of the horizontal layers, and thus the layer scale. A puzzling feature is the relatively weak dependence of layer scale on local salinity, though the vigour of convection and the rate of melting are greater where the salinity is high.
            The direct application of our results to oceanographic situations predicts layer scales under typical summer conditions of order tens of metres in the Antarctic and of order metres in the Arctic. More measurements will be needed, especially close to icebergs, before the application of these ideas to polar regions can be properly evaluated.},

We deﬁne a stratiﬁcation parameter, S = N2Q/Φo, that describes where stratiﬁcation will be important, where N is the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, Q is the height-dependent plume volume ﬂux and Φo is the buoyancy ﬂux per unit area without stratiﬁcation. The relevance of this stratiﬁcation parameter is supported by our experiments, which deviate from the homogeneous theory at approximately S = 1. Finally, we calculate values for the stratiﬁcation parameter at a number of ice shelves and conclude that ocean stratiﬁcation will have a signiﬁcant effect on the dissolution of both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.},

    abstract = {, Bubble curtains are multiphase line plumes that are used to reduce buoyancy-driven flows between two water zones at different densities. They are similar to air curtains, plane turbulent jets, that are installed in doorways of buildings between two climatically different environments. In this study, we establish a formal analogy between bubble curtains and air curtains and unify the two frameworks for their description that had previously been used. By means of small-scale laboratory experiments conducted in a channel with freshwater and brine solutions, we study how effectively a bubble curtain acts as a separation barrier for a wide range of density differences as well as different air fluxes and water depths. Qualitatively, two regimes of operation of a bubble curtain are identified and we establish the optimum operating conditions on the basis of quantitative measurements and theoretical considerations. We develop a theoretical model to calculate the infiltration flux of dense water across the bubble curtain that is in very good agreement with experimental measurements and yields a theoretical upper limit on the effectiveness of the bubble curtain. We also study the zones of mixed fluid around the bubble curtain, provide a scaling law for their horizontal extent as well as theoretically predict the water density inside these mixed zones. We discuss how the theoretical models derived from our small-scale experiments apply to real-scale bubble curtains that are, for example, used in ship locks.},

    abstract = {We investigate the effect of an external freshwater plume on the dissolution of a vertical ice wall in salty water using laboratory experiments. We measure the plume velocity, the ablation velocity of the ice and the temperature at the ice wall. The freshwater volume ﬂux, Qs, is varied between experiments to determine where the resultant wall plume transitions from being dominated by the distributed buoyancy ﬂux due to dissolution of the ice, to being dominated by the initial buoyancy ﬂux, Bs. We ﬁnd that when Bs is signiﬁcantly larger than the distributed buoyancy ﬂux from dissolution, the plume velocity is uniform with height and is proportional to Bs1/3, the interface temperature is independent of Bs, and the ablation velocity increases with Bs.},

    abstract = {We investigate the convection and dissolution rate generated when a wall of ice dissolves into seawater under Antarctic Ocean conditions. In direct numerical simulations three coupled interface equations are used to solve for interface temperature, salinity and ablation velocity, along with the boundary layer flow and transport. The main focus is on ambient water temperatures between
                  \$-1{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}{\textbackslash}text\{C\}\$
              and
                  \$6{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}{\textbackslash}text\{C\}\$
              and salinities around 35 ‰, where diffusion of salt to the ice–water interface depresses the freezing point and enhances heat diffusion to the ice. We show that fluxes of both heat and salt to the interface are significant in governing the dissolution of ice, and the ablation velocity agrees well with experiments and a recent theoretical prediction. The same turbulent flow dynamics and ablation rate are expected to apply at any depth in a deeper ocean water column (after choosing the relevant pressure coefficient for the liquidus temperature). At Grashof numbers currently accessible by direct numerical simulation, turbulence is generated both directly from buoyancy flux and from shear production in the buoyancy-driven boundary layer flow, whereas shear production by the convective flow is expected to be more important at geophysical scales. The momentum balance in the boundary layer is dominated by buoyancy forcing and wall stress, with the latter characterised by a large drag coefficient.},

Our experiments give a top-hat entrainment coefﬁcient of 0.048 ± 0.006. We measure a maximum vertical plume velocity that follows the scaling predicted by Cooper \& Hunt but is signiﬁcantly smaller. Our measurements allow us to construct a turbulent plume model that predicts all plume properties at any height. We use this plume model to calculate plume widths, velocities and Reynolds numbers for typical dissolving icebergs and ice fronts and for a typical room with a heated or cooled vertical surface.},
