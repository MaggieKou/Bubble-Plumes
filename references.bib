    abstract = {Buoyant plumes form when glacial ice melts directly into the ocean or when subglacial meltwater is discharged to the ocean at depth. They play a key role in regulating heat transport from the ocean to the ice front, and in exporting glacial meltwater to the open ocean. This review summarises current understanding of the dynamics of these plumes, focussing on theoretical developments and their predictions for submarine melt rates. These predictions are sensitive to ocean temperature, the magnitude and spatial distribution of subglacial discharge, the ambient stratiﬁcation and, in the case of sub-ice-shelf plumes, the geometry of the ice shelf. However, current understanding relies heavily on parameterisations of melting and entrainment for which there is little in the way of validation. New observational and experimental constraints are needed to elucidate the structure of the plumes and lend greater conﬁdence to the models.},

The pattern of shelf thinning mirrors that of their grounded tributaries - the Pine Island, Thwaites and Smith glaciers - and ocean currents on average 0.5°C warmer than freezing appear to be the source. The synchronised imbalance of the inland glaciers is the result of reduced lateral and basal tractions at their termini, and the drawdown of grounded ice shows that Antarctica is more sensitive to changing climates than was previously considered.},

    abstract = {In an experimental and theoretical study we model the convection generated in the polar oceans when a fresh-water ice wall melts in salt water of uniform far-field temperature T∞, and salinity S∞. Our laboratory results show that there are three different flow regimes which depend on T∞ and S∞. First, when T∞ and S∞ lie between the maximum density curve and the freezing curve, the flow is only upward. Secondly, for the oceanic case 30 [les ] S∞ [les ] 35‰ and T∞ {\textless} 20°C, the flow consists of a laminar bidirectional flow at the bottom of the ice and a turbulent upward flow along the remainder of the ice wall. The laminar flow consists of an upward flowing layer approximately 2 mm thick inside of a downward flowing outer layer approximately 10 mm thick. Thirdly, for the same range of S∞ but for T∞ {\textgreater} 20°C, the flow reverses: at the top of the ice there is a laminar bidirectional flow above a downward turbulent flow. To model the turbulent upward flow theoretically, we numerically solve the governing equations in similarity form with a spatially varying eddy diffusivity that depends on the density difference between the ice-water interface and the far-field. The laboratory data then allows us to evaluate the dependence of eddy diffusivity on T∞ and S∞. The results show that the magnitude of the eddy diffusivity is of the same order as the molecular viscosity and that both mass injection at the interface and opposed buoyancy forces must be included in a realistic flow model. Finally, we use an integral approach to predict the far-field conditions that yield the high-temperature flow reversal and obtain a result consistent with our observations.},

    abstract = {Parameterizations of turbulent transfer through the oceanic boundary layer beneath an ice shelf are tested using direct measurements of basal ablation. Observations were made in the southwestern part of Ronne Ice Shelf, about 500 km from open water. The mean basal ablation rate was measured over a month-long and a year-long period using phase-sensitive radar to record the thinning of the ice shelf. Ocean temperatures were observed within about 25 m of the ice shelf base over the period of the radar observations, while the tidally dominated ocean currents were estimated from tidal analysis of collocated current observations from an earlier period. Ablation rates derived using these ocean data and a number of bulk parameterizations of turbulent transfer within the boundary layer are compared with the direct measurements. The ablation rates derived using a parameterization that explicitly includes the impact of ocean currents on the turbulent transfer of heat and salt match the observations to within 40\%; with suitable tuning of the drag coefficient, the mismatch can be reduced below the level of the observational errors. Equally good agreement can be obtained with two slightly simpler, current-dependent parameterizations that use constant turbulent transfer coefficients, and the optimal values for the coefficients at this particular location on Ronne Ice Shelf are given.},

An overly simplistic parameterization of the molecular sublayers of temperature and salinity within the mixed layer was used. This paper investigates the use of a more recent parameterization by Yaglom and Kader which is supported by laboratory data. A relatively low melt rate results in the case where ice overlays warm water. This agrees with some recent observations in the interior of the marginal ice zone. A surface heat sink drives the freezing case which, due to the large difference in heat and salt molecular diffusivities, produces a strong supercooling effect. This is converted into an estimate of frazil ice production through a simple scheme. The model results provide an explanation for high frazil ice concentrations observed in the Arctic and Antarctic.},

    abstract = {A model is developed for turbulent natural convection in boundary layers formed next to isothermal vertical surfaces. A scaling analysis shows that the flow can be described by plume equations for an outer turbulent region coupled to a resolved near-wall laminar flow. On the laboratory scale, the inner layer is dominated by its own buoyancy and the Nusselt number scales as the one-third power of the Rayleigh number (
              Nu
              ∝
                \$\{{\textbackslash}it Ra\}\_z{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}\$
              ). This gives a constant heat flux, consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies. On larger geophysical scales the buoyancy is strongest in the outer layer and the laminar layer is driven by the shear imposed on it. The predicted heat transfer correlation then has the Nusselt number proportional to the one-half power of Rayleigh number (
              Nu
              ∝
                \$\{{\textbackslash}it Ra\}\_z{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$
              ) so that a larger heat flux is predicted than might be expected from an extrapolation of laboratory-scale results. The criteria for transitions between flow regimes are consistent with a hierarchy of instabilities of the near-wall laminar flow, with a buoyancy-driven instability operating on the laboratory scale and a shear-driven instability operating on geophysical scales.},

    abstract = {Properly describing heat and salt flux at the ice/ocean interface is essential for understanding and modeling the energy and mass balance of drifting sea ice. Basal growth or ablation depends on the ratio, R, of the interface heat exchange coefficient to that of salt, such that as R increases so does the rate-limiting impact of salt diffusion. Observations of relatively slow melt rates in above freezing seawater (plus migration of summer “false bottoms”) suggest by analogy with laboratory studies that double diffusion of heat and salt from the ocean is important during the melting process, with numeric values for R estimated to range from 35 to 70. If the same double-diffusive principles apply for ice growth as for melting (i.e., if the process is symmetric), supercooling (possibly relieved by frazil crystal production) would occur under rapidly growing ice, yet neither extensive supercooling nor frazil accumulation is found in Arctic pack ice with limited atmospheric contact. Physical properties and turbulent fluxes of heat and salt were measured in the relatively controlled setting of a tidally driven Svalbard fjord, under growing fast ice in late winter. The data failed to show supercooling, frazil production, or enhanced heat flux, suggesting that the double diffusive process is asymmetric. Modeling results compared with measured turbulent fluxes imply that R = 1 when ice freezes; i.e., that double-diffusive tendencies are relieved at or above the immediate interface. An algorithm for calculating ice/ocean heat and salt flux accommodating the different processes is presented, along with recommended ranges for the interface exchange coefficients.},
