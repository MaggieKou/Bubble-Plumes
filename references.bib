    abstract = {Buoyant plumes form when glacial ice melts directly into the ocean or when subglacial meltwater is discharged to the ocean at depth. They play a key role in regulating heat transport from the ocean to the ice front, and in exporting glacial meltwater to the open ocean. This review summarises current understanding of the dynamics of these plumes, focussing on theoretical developments and their predictions for submarine melt rates. These predictions are sensitive to ocean temperature, the magnitude and spatial distribution of subglacial discharge, the ambient stratiﬁcation and, in the case of sub-ice-shelf plumes, the geometry of the ice shelf. However, current understanding relies heavily on parameterisations of melting and entrainment for which there is little in the way of validation. New observational and experimental constraints are needed to elucidate the structure of the plumes and lend greater conﬁdence to the models.},

    abstract = {In an experimental and theoretical study we model the convection generated in the polar oceans when a fresh-water ice wall melts in salt water of uniform far-field temperature T∞, and salinity S∞. Our laboratory results show that there are three different flow regimes which depend on T∞ and S∞. First, when T∞ and S∞ lie between the maximum density curve and the freezing curve, the flow is only upward. Secondly, for the oceanic case 30 [les ] S∞ [les ] 35‰ and T∞ {\textless} 20°C, the flow consists of a laminar bidirectional flow at the bottom of the ice and a turbulent upward flow along the remainder of the ice wall. The laminar flow consists of an upward flowing layer approximately 2 mm thick inside of a downward flowing outer layer approximately 10 mm thick. Thirdly, for the same range of S∞ but for T∞ {\textgreater} 20°C, the flow reverses: at the top of the ice there is a laminar bidirectional flow above a downward turbulent flow. To model the turbulent upward flow theoretically, we numerically solve the governing equations in similarity form with a spatially varying eddy diffusivity that depends on the density difference between the ice-water interface and the far-field. The laboratory data then allows us to evaluate the dependence of eddy diffusivity on T∞ and S∞. The results show that the magnitude of the eddy diffusivity is of the same order as the molecular viscosity and that both mass injection at the interface and opposed buoyancy forces must be included in a realistic flow model. Finally, we use an integral approach to predict the far-field conditions that yield the high-temperature flow reversal and obtain a result consistent with our observations.},

Observations were made in the southwestern part of Ronne Ice Shelf, about 500 km from open water. The mean basal ablation rate was measured over a month-long and a year-long period using phase-sensitive radar to record the thinning of the ice shelf. Ocean temperatures were observed within about 25 m of the ice shelf base over the period of the radar observations, while the tidally dominated ocean currents were estimated from tidal analysis of collocated current observations from an earlier period. Ablation rates derived using these ocean data and a number of bulk parameterizations of turbulent transfer within the boundary layer are compared with the direct measurements. The ablation rates derived using a parameterization that explicitly includes the impact of ocean currents on the turbulent transfer of heat and salt match the observations to within 40\%; with suitable tuning of the drag coefficient, the mismatch can be reduced below the level of the observational errors. Equally good agreement can be obtained with two slightly simpler, current-dependent parameterizations that use constant turbulent transfer coefficients, and the optimal values for the coefficients at this particular location on Ronne Ice Shelf are given.},

A relatively low melt rate results in the case where ice overlays warm water. This agrees with some recent observations in the interior of the marginal ice zone. A surface heat sink drives the freezing case which, due to the large difference in heat and salt molecular diffusivities, produces a strong supercooling effect. This is converted into an estimate of frazil ice production through a simple scheme. The model results provide an explanation for high frazil ice concentrations observed in the Arctic and Antarctic.},

A scaling analysis shows that the flow can be described by plume equations for an outer turbulent region coupled to a resolved near-wall laminar flow. On the laboratory scale, the inner layer is dominated by its own buoyancy and the Nusselt number scales as the one-third power of the Rayleigh number (

On larger geophysical scales the buoyancy is strongest in the outer layer and the laminar layer is driven by the shear imposed on it. The predicted heat transfer correlation then has the Nusselt number proportional to the one-half power of Rayleigh number (

The criteria for transitions between flow regimes are consistent with a hierarchy of instabilities of the near-wall laminar flow, with a buoyancy-driven instability operating on the laboratory scale and a shear-driven instability operating on geophysical scales.},

    abstract = {Properly describing heat and salt flux at the ice/ocean interface is essential for understanding and modeling the energy and mass balance of drifting sea ice. Basal growth or ablation depends on the ratio, R, of the interface heat exchange coefficient to that of salt, such that as R increases so does the rate-limiting impact of salt diffusion. Observations of relatively slow melt rates in above freezing seawater (plus migration of summer “false bottoms”) suggest by analogy with laboratory studies that double diffusion of heat and salt from the ocean is important during the melting process, with numeric values for R estimated to range from 35 to 70. If the same double-diffusive principles apply for ice growth as for melting (i.e., if the process is symmetric), supercooling (possibly relieved by frazil crystal production) would occur under rapidly growing ice, yet neither extensive supercooling nor frazil accumulation is found in Arctic pack ice with limited atmospheric contact. Physical properties and turbulent fluxes of heat and salt were measured in the relatively controlled setting of a tidally driven Svalbard fjord, under growing fast ice in late winter. The data failed to show supercooling, frazil production, or enhanced heat flux, suggesting that the double diffusive process is asymmetric. Modeling results compared with measured turbulent fluxes imply that R = 1 when ice freezes; i.e., that double-diffusive tendencies are relieved at or above the immediate interface. An algorithm for calculating ice/ocean heat and salt flux accommodating the different processes is presented, along with recommended ranges for the interface exchange coefficients.},

    abstract = {Subglacial meltwater draining along the bed of fast-ﬂowing, marine-terminating glaciers emerges at the grounding line, where the ice either goes aﬂoat to form an ice shelf or terminates in a calving face. The input of freshwater to the ocean provides a source of buoyancy and drives convective motion alongside the ice–ocean interface. This process is modeled using the theory of buoyant plumes that has previously been applied to the study of the larger-scale circulation beneath ice shelves. The plume grows through entrainment of ocean waters, and the heat brought into the plume as a result drives melting at the ice–ocean interface. The equations are nondimensionalized by using scales appropriate for the region where the subglacial drainage, rather than the subsequent addition of meltwater, supplies the majority of the buoyancy forcing. It is found that the melt rate within this region can be approximated reasonably well by a function that is linear in ocean temperature, has a cube root dependence on the ﬂux of subglacial meltwater, and has a complex dependency on the slope of the ice–ocean interface. The model is used to investigate variability in melting induced by changes in both ocean temperature and subglacial discharge for a number of realistic examples of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers. The results show how warming ocean waters and increasing subglacial drainage both generate increases in melting near the grounding line.},

    abstract = {Idealized laboratory experiments have been conducted in a two-layer stratified fluid to investigate the leading-order dynamics that control submarine melting and meltwater export near a vertical ice–ocean interface as a function of subglacial discharge. In summer, the discharge of surface runoff at the base of a glacier (subglacial discharge) generates strong buoyant plumes that rise along the glacier front entraining ambient water along the way. The entrainment enhances the heat transport toward the glacier front and hence the submarine melt rate increases with the subglacial discharge rate. In the laboratory, the effect of subglacial discharge is simulated by introducing freshwater at freezing temperature from a point source at the base of an ice block representing the glacier. The circulation pattern observed both with and without subglacial discharge resembles those observed in previous observational and numerical studies. Buoyant plumes rise vertically until they find either their neutrally buoyant level or the free surface. Hence, the meltwater can deposit within the interior of the water column and not entirely at the free surface, as confirmed by field observations. The heat budget in the tank, calculated following a new framework, gives estimates of submarine melt rate that increase with the subglacial discharge and are in agreement with the directly measured submarine melting. This laboratory study provides the first direct measurements of submarine melt rates for different subglacial discharges, and the results are consistent with the predictions of previous theoretical and numerical studies.},

The experiments reported here are aimed at quantifying this effect, which could be of some importance in the application to melting icebergs. Experiments have also been carried out with heated and cooled vertical walls at larger Rayleigh numbers
              R
              than those of previous experiments.
              The main result is that for most of our experiments there is no significant difference between these three cases when properly scaled. The layer thickness over a wide range of

                w
              is approximately 0°C, whereas in colder water the freezing point depression must be taken explicitly into account. A detailed examination of the vertically flowing inner melt water layer in both homogeneous and salinity stratified cases has been made. This layer and the melt water which is mixed outwards from it into the turbulent horizontal layers have little effect on the outer flow. At high
              R
              and large external salinity, however, mixing can reduce the effective salinity at the inner edge of the horizontal layers, and thus the layer scale. A puzzling feature is the relatively weak dependence of layer scale on local salinity, though the vigour of convection and the rate of melting are greater where the salinity is high.
            The direct application of our results to oceanographic situations predicts layer scales under typical summer conditions of order tens of metres in the Antarctic and of order metres in the Arctic. More measurements will be needed, especially close to icebergs, before the application of these ideas to polar regions can be properly evaluated.},

We deﬁne a stratiﬁcation parameter, S = N2Q/Φo, that describes where stratiﬁcation will be important, where N is the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, Q is the height-dependent plume volume ﬂux and Φo is the buoyancy ﬂux per unit area without stratiﬁcation. The relevance of this stratiﬁcation parameter is supported by our experiments, which deviate from the homogeneous theory at approximately S = 1. Finally, we calculate values for the stratiﬁcation parameter at a number of ice shelves and conclude that ocean stratiﬁcation will have a signiﬁcant effect on the dissolution of both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.},

    abstract = {, Bubble curtains are multiphase line plumes that are used to reduce buoyancy-driven flows between two water zones at different densities. They are similar to air curtains, plane turbulent jets, that are installed in doorways of buildings between two climatically different environments. In this study, we establish a formal analogy between bubble curtains and air curtains and unify the two frameworks for their description that had previously been used. By means of small-scale laboratory experiments conducted in a channel with freshwater and brine solutions, we study how effectively a bubble curtain acts as a separation barrier for a wide range of density differences as well as different air fluxes and water depths. Qualitatively, two regimes of operation of a bubble curtain are identified and we establish the optimum operating conditions on the basis of quantitative measurements and theoretical considerations. We develop a theoretical model to calculate the infiltration flux of dense water across the bubble curtain that is in very good agreement with experimental measurements and yields a theoretical upper limit on the effectiveness of the bubble curtain. We also study the zones of mixed fluid around the bubble curtain, provide a scaling law for their horizontal extent as well as theoretically predict the water density inside these mixed zones. We discuss how the theoretical models derived from our small-scale experiments apply to real-scale bubble curtains that are, for example, used in ship locks.},

The same turbulent flow dynamics and ablation rate are expected to apply at any depth in a deeper ocean water column (after choosing the relevant pressure coefficient for the liquidus temperature). At Grashof numbers currently accessible by direct numerical simulation, turbulence is generated both directly from buoyancy flux and from shear production in the buoyancy-driven boundary layer flow, whereas shear production by the convective flow is expected to be more important at geophysical scales. The momentum balance in the boundary layer is dominated by buoyancy forcing and wall stress, with the latter characterised by a large drag coefficient.},

    abstract = {Thermodynamic ablation of ice in contact with the ocean is an essential element of ice sheet and ocean interactions but is challenging to model and quantify. Building on earlier observations of sea ice ablation, a variety of recent theoretical, experimental and observational studies have considered ice ablation in contrasting geometries, from vertical to near-horizontal ice faces, and reveal different scaling behaviour for predicted ablation rates in different dynamical regimes. However, uncertainties remain about when the contrasting results should be applied, as existing model parameterisations do not capture all relevant regimes of ice–ocean ablation. To progress towards improved models of ice–ocean interaction, we synthesise current understanding into a classification of ablation types. We examine the effect of the classification on the parameterisation of turbulent fluxes from the ocean towards the ice, and identify the dominant processes next to ice interfaces of different orientation. Four ablation types are defined: melting and dissolving based on ocean temperatures, and shear-controlled and buoyancy-controlled regimes based on the dynamics of the near-ice molecular sublayer. We describe existing observational and modelling studies of sea ice, ice shelves, and glacier termini, as well as laboratory studies, to show how they fit into this classification. Two sets of observations from the Ross and Ronne Ice Shelf cavities suggest that both the buoyancy-controlled and shear-controlled regimes may be relevant under different oceanographic conditions. Overall, buoyancy-controlled dynamics are more likely when the molecular sublayer has lower Reynolds number, and shear for higher Reynolds number, although the observations suggest some variability about this trend.},

Although there is mixing, the amount of energy dissipated is small, reducing the current speed by a few percent from the energy-conserving value. Benjamin (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 31, 1968, p. 209) suggests that dissipation is an essential ingredient in gravity current dynamics. We show that dissipation is not important at high Reynolds number, and provide an alternative theory that predicts the current speed and depth based on energy-conserving flow that is in good agreement with experiments. We predict that in a deep ambient the front Froude number is 1, rather than the previously accepted value of 2–√2{\textbackslash}sqrt 2. New experiments are reported for this case that support the new theoretical value.},

Ablation of the ice undersurface increased rapidly after crossing the surface temperature front, and the observed melt rate corresponded with direct heat flux measurements in the oceanic boundary layer, with maximum upward heat flux of about 200 W m−2. We discuss overall momentum and energy balances, interpret observed boundary layer measurements with a numerical model, and show that molecular effects are important for heat and mass transport at the hydraulically rough ice-ocean interface.

The computed response to various levels of thermal driving and turbulent agitation in the mixed layer is discussed, as is the effect of various treatments of the conductive heat flux into the ice shelf. The performance of the different formulations that have been used in models of sub-ice-shelf circulation is assessed in comparison with observations of the turbulent heat flux beneath sea ice. Formulations that include an explicit parameterization of the oceanic boundary layer give results that lie within about 30\% of observation.

However, the calving process itself remains poorly understood and is not well parametrized in current numerical ice sheet models. In this study, we address this uncertainty by deriving plausible upper and lower limits for the maximum stable ice thickness at the calving face of marine-terminating glaciers, using two complementary models. The first model assumes that a combination of tensile and shear failure can render the ice cliff near the terminus unstable and/or enable pre-existing crevasses to intersect. A direct consequence of this model is that thick glaciers must terminate in deep water to stabilize the calving front, yielding a predicted maximum ice cliff height that increases with increasing water depth, consistent with observations culled from glaciers in West Greenland, Antarctica, Svalbard and Alaska. The second model considers an analogous lower limit derived by assuming that the ice is already fractured and fractures are lubricated by pore pressure. In this model, a floating ice tongue can only form when the ice entering the terminus region is relatively intact with few pre-existing, deeply penetrating crevasses.},

We present a suite of fjord salinity, temperature, turbidity versus depth casts along with glacial runoff estimation from Rink and Store glaciers, two major marine outlets draining the western sector of the GrIS during 2009 and 2010. We characterise the main water bodies present and interpret their interaction with their respective calving fronts. We identify two distinct processes of ice–ocean interaction which have distinct spatial and temporal footprints: (1) homogenous free convective melting which occurs across the calving front where AW is in direct contact with the ice mass, and (2) localised upwelling-driven melt by turbulent subglacial runoff mixing with fjord water which occurs at distinct injection points across the calving front. Throughout the study, AW at 2.8 ± 0.2 °C was consistently observed in contact with both glaciers below 450 m depth, yielding homogenous, free convective submarine melting up to {\textasciitilde}200 m depth. Above this bottom layer, multiple interactions are identified, primarily controlled by the rate of subglacial fresh-water discharge which results in localised and discrete upwelling plumes. In the record melt year of 2010, the Store Glacier calving face was dominated by these runoff-driven plumes which led to a highly crenulated frontal geometry characterised by large embayments at the subglacial portals separated by headlands which are dominated by calving. Rink Glacier, which is significantly deeper than Store has a larger proportion of its submerged calving face exposed to AW, which results in a uniform, relatively flat overall frontal geometry.},

    abstract = {The largest uncertainty in future sea-level rise is loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. Ice shelves, freely floating platforms of ice that fringe the ice sheets, play a crucial role in restraining discharge of grounded ice into the ocean through buttressing. However, since the 1990s, several ice shelves have thinned, retreated, and collapsed. If this pattern continues, it could expose thick cliffs that become structurally unstable and collapse in a process called marine ice cliff instability (MICI). However, the feedbacks between calving, retreat, and other forcings are not well understood. Here we review observed modes of calving from ice shelves and marine-terminating glaciers, and their relation to environmental forces. We show that the primary driver of calving is long-term internal glaciological stress, but as ice shelves thin they may become more vulnerable to environmental forcing. This vulnerability—and the potential for MICI—comes from a combination of the distribution of preexisting flaws within the ice and regions where the stress is large enough to initiate fracture. Although significant progress has been made modeling these processes, theories must now be tested against a wide range of environmental and glaciological conditions in both modern and paleo conditions.
▪Ice shelves, floating platforms of ice fed by ice sheets, shed mass in a near-instantaneous fashion through iceberg calving.▪Most ice shelves exhibit a stable cycle of calving front advance and retreat that is insensitive to small changes in environmental conditions.▪Some ice shelves have retreated or collapsed completely, and in the future this could expose thick cliffs that could become structurally unstable called ice cliff instability.▪The potential for ice shelf and ice cliff instability is controlled by the presence and evolution of flaws or fractures within the ice.},

    abstract = {The response of ice shelf basal melting to climate is a function of ocean temperature, circulation, and mixing in the open ocean and the coupling of this external forcing to the sub–ice shelf circulation. Because slope strongly influences the properties of buoyancy-driven flow near the ice shelf base, ice shelf morphology plays a critical role in linking external, subsurface heat sources to the ice. In this paper, the slope-driven dynamic control of local and area-integrated melting rates is examined under a wide range of ocean temperatures and ice shelf shapes, with an emphasis on smaller, steeper ice shelves. A 3-D numerical ocean model is used to simulate the circulation underneath five idealized ice shelves, forced with subsurface ocean temperatures ranging from −2.0°C to 1.5°C. In the sub–ice shelf mixed layer, three spatially distinct dynamic regimes are present. Entrainment of heat occurs predominately under deeper sections of the ice shelf; local and area-integrated melting rates are most sensitive to changes in slope in this “initiation” region. Some entrained heat is advected upslope and used to melt ice in the “maintenance” region; however, flow convergence in the “outflow” region limits heat loss in flatter portions of the ice shelf. Heat flux to the ice exhibits (1) a spatially nonuniform, superlinear dependence on slope and (2) a shape- and temperature-dependent, internally controlled efficiency. Because the efficiency of heat flux through the mixed layer decreases with increasing ocean temperature, numerical simulations diverge from a simple quadratic scaling law.},

    abstract = {While it has been shown repeatedly that ocean conditions exhibit an important control on the behaviour of grounded tidewater glaciers, modelling studies have focused largely on the effects of basal and surface melting. Here, a finite-element model of stresses near the front of a tidewater glacier is used to investigate the effects of frontal melting on calving, independently of the calving criterion used. Applications of the stress model to idealized scenarios reveal that undercutting of the ice front due to frontal melting can drive calving at up to ten times the mean melt rate. Factors which cause increased frontal melt-driven calving include a strong thermal gradient in the ice, and a concentration of frontal melt at the base of the glacier. These properties are typical of both Arctic and Antarctic tidewater glaciers. The finding that frontal melt near the base is a strong driver of calving leads to the conclusion that water temperatures near the bed of the glacier are critically important to the glacier front, and thus the flow of the glacier. These conclusions are robust against changes in the basal boundary condition and the choice of calving criterion, as well as variations in the glacier size or level of crevassing.},
